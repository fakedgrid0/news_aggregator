Ok, so web scraping consistently is hard
Some websites block me while some don't
Some have a good structure while some are just awfully cluttered
Honestly, it is not possible to make a universal news aggregator

Because of all these reasons, the scope is to scrape a minimum of 3 international news websites
And if possible, add personalization.
